# Revenix Docs

> This docs set is intentionally short and operational. It focuses on deployment and real troubleshooting signals.

## Read First

- `windows-agent.md`: Windows endpoint install and validation flow
- `troubleshooting.md`: flow ingestion, task status, and alert quality checks

## Core References

- Main overview: `../README.md`
- Windows installer details: `../agents/windows/README.md`

> If your goal is "agent installs with minimal user actions", standardize the distributed bundle to include `agent.env`, `npcap-installer.exe`, and optional `vc_redist.x64.exe`.
